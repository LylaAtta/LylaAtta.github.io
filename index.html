description: MD-PhD Candidate, Johns Hopkins University

Hello!  

I am an MD-PhD student at Johns Hopkins University. I am currently in the first year of my PhD in Biomedical Engineering in the <a href="jef.works">JEFworks</a> lab. I am broadly interested in systems and computational biology and how we can develop data-driven mathematical models to better understand complexity in disease.  

I received my undergraduate degree in Biological Engineering at MIT with a minor in Statistics and Data Science. As an undergraduate, I conducted research in systems biology and synthetic biology.  

Outside of my research, I am interested in data science education and medical education.
