			<p>Hello!</p>

			<p>I am an MD-PhD student at Johns Hopkins University. I am currently a PhD in Biomedical Engineering in the <a href="https://jef.works/">JEFworks</a> lab. I am broadly interested in systems and computational biology and how we can develop data-driven mathematical models to better understand complexity in disease.</p>  

			<p>I received my undergraduate degree in Biological Engineering at MIT with a minor in Statistics and Data Science. As an undergraduate, I conducted research in systems biology and synthetic biology.</p>  

			<p>Outside of my research, I am interested in data science education and medical education.</p>
